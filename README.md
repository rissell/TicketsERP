# TicketsERP

Create tickes linked to Oddo ERP and to a fixed assets on a company or organization.

TicketsERP will be deployed as a Add-On or module of the selected open source ERP. Our priority is to have the web application running, and mobile app is a nice to have item.

## The Back-end
The back end is developed in python 2.7.15 with some libraries required to parse the url, setup a web server framework, and use mysql connections. As default the port number for the API is 8080. This backend API is used to communicate with the web client, ODOO and the tickets database. There are methods in order to get the tickets generated by a user, create tickets, show tickets and more. So far, there are CRUD operations for the tickets. This API is called from different endpoints such as `/tickets`or `/inventory` or parametrized URL such as `/tickets?id=TKT00001`. The API sends a response in JSON format with its necessary headers. Here is an example of the request from `/tickets`: 

```json
    [ 
        "AX123456",
        "TKT00003",
        "Hello, idk what happened here.",
        "4204",
        0,
        ""
    ],
    [
        "AX123456",
        "TKT00128",
        "Hello, idk what happened here.",
        "4204",
        0,
        ""
    ]
```
